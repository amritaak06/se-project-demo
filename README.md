# 🚀 Python CI Project with GitHub Actions and SonarCloud

This project is a Python application set up with a robust Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using **GitHub Actions** and **SonarCloud**. It includes:

- Linting via `flake8`
- Unit testing with `pytest`
- Code coverage tracking via `coverage`
- Quality gate checks using SonarCloud

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed locally:

- Python 3.10+
- pip

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## ✅ Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
pytest

# Run tests with code coverage
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report -m
```

---

## 🧪 Linting with flake8

```bash
pip install flake8
flake8 .
```

---

## ☁️ SonarCloud Integration

Ensure your `sonar-project.properties` is correctly set up:

```properties
sonar.projectKey=<your_project_key>
sonar.organization=<your_organization>
sonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io
sonar.python.coverage.reportPaths=coverage.xml
```

Generate coverage report in XML format:

```bash
coverage xml
```

---

## 🔄 CI Pipeline

Every push or pull request triggers the GitHub Actions pipeline, which performs:

* Dependency installation
* Lint checks
* Unit tests
* Coverage check
* SonarCloud analysis

---

## 💡 Tips

* Keep your test coverage above 80% to pass SonarCloud’s quality gate.
* Add more test cases in `tests/` to improve coverage.
* If a step fails in GitHub Actions, check the logs under the "Actions" tab of your repository.
